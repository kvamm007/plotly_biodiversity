          Many existing bacteria are not well studied. One potential use for bacteria is to synthesize proteins that taste like certain foods. In particular, our client Improbable Beef is interested in bacteria able to sythesize proteins that taste like beef, in order to make a better beef-alternative product. 
          <br><br>
          Due to its location and structure, human bellybuttons are often teeming with bacteria. People may not shower on a daily basis, and even those who do may not do a good job of cleaning out the nooks and crevices in the bellybutton. It is also a warm, and typically somewhat moist, environment. For this reason, we are interested in further studying the bacteria that grow there, to see if one may produce our beef-flavored protein. 
          <br><br>
          We have asked subjects to submit swabs of their bellybutton biome, and are currently analyzing bacteria for their potential. Once we identify specific bacteria that may work well for this project, subjects will easily be able to view the dashboard below to see if that bacteria is among their biome and submit to further research. Note: Only the 10 most common bacteria per subject are listed; if less than 10 are listed, then all are represented for the subject; if 10 are listed, the subject could have well in excess of 10 different types of bacteria.
